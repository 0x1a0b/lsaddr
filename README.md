## Usage
The idea is to drag-and-drop you application to `lsaddr`, and it displays the network addresses that that app is using. We plan to make the output configurable, so it is easy to consume it from other programs, for example by allowing to specify output's encoding and fields.

```
lsaddr (master) $ bin/lsaddr Spotify
