## Installation
- `go get -u github.com/booster-proj/lsaddr`
- downloading the [downloader script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/booster-proj/lsaddr/master/godownloader.sh) and executing it (you can also specify the version that you want to download as argument)
- downloading your favourite release from the [releases section](https://github.com/booster-proj/lsaddr/releases)

Big thanks to [goreleaser](https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser) and [godownloader](https://github.com/goreleaser/godownloader) which made the releasing process **FUN**! ðŸ¤©

## Usage
The idea is to easily filter the list of open network files of a specific application. The list is filtered with a regular expression: only
the lines that match against it are kept, the others discarded. You can pass to `lsaddr` either directly the regex, or the root folder of the
target app (supported only on macOS for now). Check out some examples:

```
lsaddr (master) $ bin/lsaddr Spotify --out=csv

```
Note: "/Applications/Spotify.app" is used to find the application's name, then its
process identifiers are used to build the regular expression.

```
Note: `--debug` information is printed to `stderr`, command's output to `stdout`.
```
lsaddr (master) $ bin/lsaddr /Applications/Spotify.app/ --out=bpf
host 104.199.64.253 or 2.16.186.91 or 151.101.112.246 or 35.186.224.53 or 35.186.224.47
```
Note: you can encode the output either in csv or as a [bpf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Packet_Filter) (hint: very useful for packet capturing tools)
