## Usage
The idea is to easily filter the list of open network files of a specific application. The list is filtered with a regular expression: only the lines that match against it are kept, the others discarded.

## Examples
#### Find connections opened by "Spotify"
```
% bin/lsaddr Spotify
PID,CMD,NET,SRC,DST
62822,Spotify,tcp,10.7.152.118:52213,104.199.64.50:80
62822,Spotify,tcp,10.7.152.118:52255,35.186.224.47:443
62826,Spotify,tcp,10.7.152.118:52196,35.186.224.53:443
```

#### Increment verbosity (debugging)
Note: `debug` information is printed to `stderr`, command's output to `stdout`.
```
% bin/lsaddr Spotify --verbose
...
```
(output omitted for readiness)

#### Dump Spotify's network traffic using tcpdump
```
% bin/lsaddr -f bpf Spotify | xargs -0 sudo tcpdump
```
