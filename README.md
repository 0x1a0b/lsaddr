## Usage
The idea is to easily filter the list of open network files of a specific application. The list is filtered with a regular expression: only
the lines that match against it are kept, the others discarded. You can pass to `lsaddr` either directly the regex, or the root folder of the
target app (supported only on macOS for now). Check out some examples:

```
lsaddr (master) $ bin/lsaddr Spotify
192.168.0.61:49973->2.16.106.146:80
192.168.0.61:49501->192.121.140.177:80
192.168.0.61:49235->104.199.64.158:4070
192.168.0.61:49252->35.186.224.53:443
192.168.0.61:49671->35.186.224.47:443
192.168.0.61:49974->2.16.186.11:80
```
Note: "Spotify" is used as a regular expression.
```
lsaddr (master) $ bin/lsaddr /Applications/Spotify.app
192.168.0.61:49973->2.16.106.146:80
192.168.0.61:49501->192.121.140.177:80
192.168.0.61:49235->104.199.64.158:4070
192.168.0.61:49252->35.186.224.53:443
192.168.0.61:49671->35.186.224.47:443
192.168.0.61:49974->2.16.186.11:80
```
Note: "/Applications/Spotify.app" is used to find the application's name, then its
process identifiers are used to build the regular expression.
```
lsaddr (master) $ bin/lsaddr /Applications/Spotify.app --debug

192.168.0.61:49974->2.16.186.11:80
```
Note: `--debug` information is printed to `stderr`, command's output to `stdout`.
