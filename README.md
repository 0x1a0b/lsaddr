## Usage
The idea is to easily filter the list of open network files of a specific application. The list is filtered with a regular expression: only
the lines that match against it are kept, the others discarded. You can pass to `lsaddr` either directly the regex, or the root folder of the
target app (supported only on macOS for now). Check out some examples:

```
$ bin/lsaddr Spotify
COMMAND,NET,SRC,DST
Spotify,tcp,192.168.0.98:54862,104.199.64.69:4070
Spotify,tcp,*:57621,
Spotify,tcp,*:54850,
Spotify,udp,*:57621,
Spotify,udp,*:1900,
Spotify,udp,*:61152,
Spotify,udp,*:51535,
Spotify,tcp,192.168.0.98:54878,35.186.224.47:443
Spotify,tcp,192.168.0.98:54872,35.186.224.53:443
```
Note: "Spotify" is used as a regular expression.
```
$ bin/lsaddr /Applications/Spotify.app/
COMMAND,NET,SRC,DST
Spotify,tcp,192.168.0.98:54862,104.199.64.69:4070
Spotify,tcp,*:57621,
Spotify,tcp,*:54850,
Spotify,udp,*:57621,
Spotify,udp,*:1900,
Spotify,udp,*:61152,
Spotify,udp,*:51535,
Spotify,tcp,192.168.0.98:54878,35.186.224.47:443
Spotify,tcp,192.168.0.98:54872,35.186.224.53:443
```
Note: "/Applications/Spotify.app" is used to find the application's name, then its
process identifiers are used to build the regular expression.
```
$ bin/lsaddr /Applications/Spotify.app/ --debug
[lsaddr] 2019/07/12 14:29:50 app name: Spotify, path: /Applications/Spotify.app
[lsaddr] 2019/07/12 14:29:50 regexp built: "48042|48044|48045|48047"
[lsaddr] 2019/07/12 14:29:50 # of open files: 9
COMMAND,NET,SRC,DST
Spotify,tcp,192.168.0.98:54862,104.199.64.69:4070
Spotify,tcp,*:57621,
Spotify,tcp,*:54850,
Spotify,udp,*:57621,
Spotify,udp,*:1900,
Spotify,udp,*:61152,
Spotify,udp,*:51535,
Spotify,tcp,192.168.0.98:54878,35.186.224.47:443
Spotify,tcp,192.168.0.98:54872,35.186.224.53:443
```
Note: `--debug` information is printed to `stderr`, command's output to `stdout`.
```
$ bin/lsaddr /Applications/Spotify.app/ --out=bpf
host 104.199.64.69 or 35.186.224.47 or 35.186.224.53
```
Notes:
- you can encode the output either in csv or as a [bpf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Packet_Filter) (hint: very useful for packet capturing tools). 
- only the unique destination addresses are taken into consideration when building the filter,
ignoring the ports and without specifing if the "direction" (incoming or outgoing) that we want to
filter. This is because the expected behaviour has not yet been defined.
