## Usage
The idea is to easily filter the list of open network files of a specific application. The list is filtered with a regular expression: only
the lines that match against it are kept, the others discarded. You can pass to `lsaddr` either directly the regex, or the root folder of the
target app (supported only on macOS for now). Check out some examples:

```
lsaddr (master) $ bin/lsaddr Spotify
COMMAND,NET,SRC,DST
Spotify,tcp,192.168.0.61:52439,104.199.64.103:4070
Spotify,tcp,192.168.0.61:54902,35.186.224.53:443
Spotify,tcp,192.168.0.61:52456,35.186.224.47:443
```
Note: "Spotify" is used as a regular expression.
```
lsaddr (master) $ bin/lsaddr /Applications/Spotify.app
COMMAND,NET,SRC,DST
Spotify,tcp,192.168.0.61:52439,104.199.64.103:4070
Spotify,tcp,192.168.0.61:54902,35.186.224.53:443
Spotify,tcp,192.168.0.61:52456,35.186.224.47:443
```
Note: "/Applications/Spotify.app" is used to find the application's name, then its
process identifiers are used to build the regular expression.
```
lsaddr (master) $ bin/lsaddr /Applications/Spotify.app --debug
[lookup] app name: Spotify, path: /Applications/Spotify.app
[lsaddr] # of open files: 9
[lsaddr] skipping open file: *:57621->

[lsaddr] skipping open file: *:1900->
[lsaddr] skipping open file: *:57313->
[lsaddr] skipping open file: *:53592->
COMMAND,NET,SRC,DST
Spotify,tcp,192.168.0.61:52439,104.199.64.103:4070
Spotify,tcp,192.168.0.61:54902,35.186.224.53:443
Spotify,tcp,192.168.0.61:52456,35.186.224.47:443
```
Note: `--debug` information is printed to `stderr`, command's output to `stdout`.
```
lsaddr (master) $ bin/lsaddr /Applications/Spotify.app/ -e=bpf
host 192.168.0.61 and port 59370 or host 104.199.65.10 and port 4070 or host 192.168.0.61 and port 59392 or host 35.186.224.47 and port 443 or host 192.168.0.61 and port 64225 or host 35.186.224.53 and port 443
```
Note: you can encode the output either in csv or as a [bpf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Packet_Filter) (hint: very useful for packet capturing tools)
Note 2: only "src" information is used to build the filter, as it will be used to match both "src" and "dst" fields on the actual packet (teoretically, see #3)
